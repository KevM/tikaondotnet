Tika on .NET
============

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ofc68okbo9s75okr?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/KevM/tikaondotnet) [![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/TikaOnDotNet.TextExtractor.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/nu/TikaOnDotNet.TextExtractor)

This project is a simple wrapper around the very excellent and robust
[Tika](http://tika.apache.org/) text extraction Java library. This project produces two nugets:
- TikaOnDotNet - A straight [IKVM](http://www.ikvm.net/userguide/ikvmc.html) hosted port of Java Tika project.

[![Install-Package TikaOnDotNet](https://cldup.com/H-IdGdU75T.png)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TikaOnDotnet/)

- TikaOnDotNet.TextExtractor - Use Tika to extract text from rich documents.

## Getting Started 

The best way to get started is to:
- Add a Nuget dependency to [TikaOnDotNet.TextExtractor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TikaOnDotNet.TextExtractor/).
- Instantiate a new `TextExtractor` object and call one of the `Extract` methods.

### Usage 
```cs
// using TikaOnDotNet.TextExtractor;

var textExtractor = new TextExtractor();

var wordDocContents = textExtractor.Extract(@".\path\to\my favorite word.docx");
var webPageContents = textExtractor.Extract(new Uri("https://google.com"));
```
