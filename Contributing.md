## A new version of Tika came out?

Did a new version of [Tika](https://tika.apache.org) come out and you want to get the Nuget updated? This is
very common so check out the Developer Guide on [Updating Tika](https://github.com/KevM/tikaondotnet/Developers.md#updating-tika).
After you've got the new version building, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
Once it is merged and a release is [tagged](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) a [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TikaOnDotNet/) will be published.

## Want to help make us better?
